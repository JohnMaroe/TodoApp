# Complete Todo App

I love todo apps, they are so useful, quick to add a task and helps tons with productivity. (and memory)
But I always felt incomplete using other's todo apps, which is why I will be creating my own version and add my own features.


### Technologies being used as of now
React ⚛️ <br />
Node ⚓ <br />
React-router-dom & React Transition Group 🚂 <br />
Styled Components 💅🏻 <br />
